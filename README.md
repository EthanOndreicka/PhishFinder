# App Objectives
Phish Finder is designed to create more awareness around phishing and have people detect phishing attempts in a gamified way. <br>
Users will go through levels which get harder and harder, trying to determine whether an email is real or fake. <br>
Users have 3 lives, each wrong answer decreasing a life as the game goes on. <br>
If the user runs out of lives *or* they complete all 15 levels they will be taken to the game over screen displaying final score and their "rank".
